Git and Github :-
                    git is present in our local devices like pc , laptops etc while github is like an cloud which is present online and can access using the internet.

some points to be remembered:-
    1. we have to make an repo with an name at github.
    2. in the terminal of vs code we have to first initialise the git with git init command.
    3. after initialise the git we have to connect the repo which is at github to the local pc using command which is git remote origin   add < link of the repo>.
    4. now we can perform operations like check the staus , add files , commmit which are in sequence.
    5. U mark means that the file is untracked ( mean that file is not newly made).
    6. M mark means that the file is modified( any changes done in any saved file)
    7. git status command is used to check the status that the files are ready to commit or not if the files are ready to commit then their name displayed in green color otherwise in red color.
    8. git commit -m " " command is used to commit the files means to save the changes (something that is written in " " will be displayed on github, eg- "first commit" , "changes done").
    9. after commit command we have to push these to github so that we can track them later and save our changes on github , we use git push origin branchname command .


some others useful commands are:-
    1. git clone :- it is used to clone any repo in your vs code.
